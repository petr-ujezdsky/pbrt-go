# pbrt-go
Physics based raytracing written in golang for my educational purpose.

Based on book [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory To Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents) and
source code at https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3.

This is basically direct conversion from c++ to golang.
